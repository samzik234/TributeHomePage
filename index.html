        Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of
        his <br> life-long war on hunger.

      <h2 id="img-caption">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>

      <div id="caption-2">
        <ul>
          <li><span class="date">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li><span class="date">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to
            a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
          <li><span class="date">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
            Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."</li>
          <li><span class="date">1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
          <li><span class="date">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
            cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest-resistant plants.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
            rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
          <li><span class="date">1942</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
            wife and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
            6,000 different strains of disease-resistant wheatâ€”including different varieties for each major climate on
            Earth.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yield
          </li>
          <li><span class="date">1953</span> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding
            American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
            wheat</li>
          <li><span class="date">1960s</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his highly-yielding strains of wheat to the
            Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1970</span> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li><span class="date">1983</span> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
            sorghum yields</li>
          <li><span class="date">1984</span> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
          <li><span class="date">2005</span> - States "we will have to double the world's food supply by 2050." Argues
            that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long
            time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
          <li><span class="date">2009</span> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
